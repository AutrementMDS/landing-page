      possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential
      purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
      limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which

      of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer,
      so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
